👋 Hi, I’m April  
- 🌱 I’m currently building a custom Shopify theme from scratch, developing an SEO app for private use within my Shopify store, and working on an app for commercial use. Additionally, I created a backend SEO app using Node.js in my command center.  
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new languages like Python and expanding my web development skills.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving Shopify development, SEO, or app development.
